# Carla Challenge in Mcity

## Where does the challenge take place?
The challenge will be hold inside the Carla version of Mcity. Mcity is a 32-acre proving ground for the testing of connected and automated vehicles located on the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We build the Carla Mcity based on the true dimensions/background of the real Mcity, and it serves as just another map of the Carla simulator. The supported Carla version is 0.9.9.4.

## What are the challenges?
<img src="resource/Route.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

The participant will be asked to control the vehicle under test (VUT) ('role_name' = "hero", spawned by the organizer) to follow a predefined route, shown as the blue curve in the figure. There will be 4 scenarios along the way, where the environment vehicles/pedestrian will attempt to challenge the VUT:
1. Cut-in
2. Car-following
3. Pedestrian crossing
4. Unprotected left turn
The VUT will be graded based on safety, speed and smoothness. 
Here is an example run of the challenge:

The nominal route for the challenge can be found in the github repo. 

## How to participate?
The simulator server and challenge scripte will be running on a dedicated server at University of Michigan. Participant are asked to remotely connect to the server through SSH tunnel with key authentication. Currently, the challenge is open to student teams from Stanford Univeristy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Michigan. 

To establish a SSH tunnel, one can use the command listed below (take MIT team as example)
```bash
ssh mit@141.211.37.251 -L 2000:localhost:2000 -L 2001:localhost:2001 -L 2002:localhost:2002
```
See the table below for the name of user assigned to the teams
|User Name|Team|
|mit| Massachusetts Institute of Technology |
|stanford| Stanford |

Once the SSH tunnel is set up, you can connect to the server as if it is running on your computer. We set the connection limitation such that only one logins across the teams could be established. So if you find SSH says `Too many logins for xxx`, that indicates that other team are connecting to the server. We make sure that only one team can connect to the server and evaluate their agent at the same time through this way. Also note that this also means each user can only have one login shell at the same time. Please use utils like `tmux` if you need multiple shells. Please also make sure that you terminated the login shell correctly so that other teams can connect in.

By default, Carla will use port 2000/2001. To enable relevant command sent to the server, we preserve the port 2002 for commands including restarting Carla server, evaluation script, etc. Therefore, you can add tunnel for 2002 when connecting. Here are the codes for sending command to control the challenge script:

```python
import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 2002))
print(s.recv(1024))
# See table below for meanings of the value
data = bytes('1', 'utf8')
s.send(data)
s.close()
```

Current implemented commands include
|Binary Value| Command|
|----|----|
|1| Initiate a test run|
|2| Initiate the pedestrian crossing challenge|
|3| Initiate the left turn challenge|

If you are interested in joining in the challenge, please contact Yuanxin(zyxin@umich.edu) or Xinpeng(xinpengw@umich.edu) first to get access to the server.
